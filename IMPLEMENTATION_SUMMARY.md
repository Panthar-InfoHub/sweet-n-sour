# Site Configuration & Review System Implementation

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Product Reviews Enhancement

#### Changes Made:

- **Smaller Review Cards**: Reduced padding and font sizes for compact display
- **Removed "Helpful" Button**: Cleaned up UI by removing the helpful/like button
- **Added Pagination**: Reviews limited to 5 per page with Previous/Next controls
- **Added Sorting**: Users can sort by:
  - Newest First (default)
  - Oldest First
  - Highest Rating
  - Lowest Rating
- **Scrollable Container**: Reviews list has max-height of 600px with scroll
- **Improved Layout**: Smaller avatars (8x8), compact spacing

#### Files Modified:

- `components/store/products/product-reviews.tsx`

### 2. Site Configuration System

#### Database Schema:

Added `SiteConfig` table with:

```prisma
model SiteConfig {
  id                       String   @id @default(cuid())
  shippingCharge           Float    @default(50)
  freeShippingMinOrder     Float    @default(500)
  showAnnouncementBar      Boolean  @default(true)
  announcementText         String   @default("Free shipping on orders above ₹500!")
  createdAt                DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt                DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

#### Features:

- **Shipping Configuration**:

  - Set custom shipping charge amount
  - Set minimum order value for free shipping
  - Automatically calculated in checkout

- **Announcement Bar**:
  - Toggle to show/hide announcement bar
  - Customizable announcement text
  - Dynamically displayed based on settings

#### Files Created:

1. **Actions**:

   - `actions/admin/site-config.actions.ts` - CRUD for site config
   - `actions/store/shipping-config.actions.ts` - Get shipping config

2. **Admin Pages**:

   - `app/admin/settings/page.tsx` - Settings management page

3. **Components**:
   - `components/admin/settings/site-config-form.tsx` - Form to edit settings
   - Updated `components/store/common/announcement-bar.tsx` - Dynamic announcement

### 3. Admin Settings Page

#### Features:

- **Shipping Settings Section**:

  - Input for shipping charge (₹)
  - Input for free shipping minimum order (₹)
  - Real-time validation with form errors

- **Announcement Bar Section**:

  - Toggle switch to enable/disable
  - Textarea for announcement text
  - Character limit (200 chars)

- **Form Actions**:
  - Save Settings button
  - Reset button
  - Loading states
  - Success/error toasts

#### Access:

Navigate to `/admin/settings` when logged in as admin

### 4. Dynamic Shipping Integration

#### How It Works:

1. Site config is fetched on checkout page load
2. Shipping charge calculated based on:
   - If order total >= `freeShippingMinOrder`: Shipping = ₹0
   - If order total < `freeShippingMinOrder`: Shipping = `shippingCharge`
3. Displayed in order summary
4. Saved with order in database

#### Actions Created:

- `getSiteConfig()` - Get current config or create default
- `updateSiteConfig(data)` - Update config (admin only)
- `calculateShippingCharge(orderTotal)` - Calculate shipping for order

## 🔄 Migration Required

### Run Migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_site_config
```

### Alternative (if drift detected):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "site_config" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "shippingCharge" DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL DEFAULT 50,
  "freeShippingMinOrder" DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL DEFAULT 500,
  "showAnnouncementBar" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  "announcementText" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Free shipping on orders above ₹500!',
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT "site_config_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);
```

Then run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Migration**: Must run migration before using site config features
2. **Admin Access**: Settings page requires ADMIN role
3. **Default Config**: Auto-created on first access if doesn't exist
4. **Shipping Calculation**: Uses site config, falls back to constants if config fails
5. **Announcement Bar**: Server component, refreshes on page navigation
