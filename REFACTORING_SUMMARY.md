# Payment Flow Refactoring - Summary

## üéØ Objectives Completed

This refactoring addressed the following issues and improvements:

### 1. ‚úÖ Order Creation Timing
**Problem**: Order was only created after payment confirmation, causing data loss if frontend failed.
**Solution**: Order is now created during payment initiation with `PENDING` status.

### 2. ‚úÖ Payment Modal Closure Handling
**Problem**: If user closed Razorpay modal, no record existed in the database.
**Solution**: Order persists in DB with `PENDING` status, allowing tracking and retry.

### 3. ‚úÖ Webhook Backup Mechanism
**Problem**: No backup if frontend confirmation failed due to network issues.
**Solution**: Implemented Razorpay webhook handler to process payments as backup.

### 4. ‚úÖ Simplified Data Flow
**Problem**: Entire order data was passed from frontend to confirmation.
**Solution**: Only order ID and payment details are passed; order data is fetched from DB.

### 5. ‚úÖ Payment Status Tracking
**Problem**: Only order status was tracked, no separate payment status.
**Solution**: Added `paymentStatus` field and displayed in admin dashboard.

### 6. ‚úÖ Failed Status Addition
**Problem**: No status for failed orders.
**Solution**: Added `FAILED` to `OrderStatus` enum for both order and payment failures.

### 7. ‚úÖ Clean Code Structure
**Problem**: Repeated code for stock deduction and coupon usage.
**Solution**: Created modular helper functions in `utils/order-helpers.ts`.

### 8. ‚úÖ Removed Redundant Fields
**Problem**: `variantWeight` was stored separately from `variantDetails`.
**Solution**: Removed redundancy, using only `variantDetails.weight`.

## üìÅ Files Modified

## üîÑ Migration Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-failed-status-and-webhook-fields
```

### 2. Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Add to `.env`:
```env
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

### 4. Configure Razorpay Webhook
1. Go to Razorpay Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/razorpay`
3. Enable events: `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`, `order.paid`
4. Copy secret to `.env`

## üìä New Order Flow

### Happy Path
```
1. User clicks "Pay Now" 
   ‚Üí Order created in DB (status: PENDING, paymentStatus: PENDING)
   
2. Razorpay modal opens
   ‚Üí User completes payment
   
3. Frontend receives payment response
   ‚Üí Calls confirmOrder with order ID
   
4. Backend verifies signature
   ‚Üí Updates order (status: PROCESSING, paymentStatus: SUCCESS)
   ‚Üí Deducts stock
   ‚Üí Updates coupon usage
   
5. User redirected to orders page
```

### Payment Modal Closed
```
1. User clicks "Pay Now"
   ‚Üí Order created in DB (status: PENDING, paymentStatus: PENDING)
   
2. Razorpay modal opens
   ‚Üí User closes modal without paying
   
3. Order remains in DB with PENDING status
   ‚Üí No stock deducted
   ‚Üí Admin can track abandoned checkouts
```

### Frontend Failure After Payment
```
1. Payment succeeds in Razorpay
   ‚Üí Frontend crashes/network fails before confirmation
   
2. Webhook receives payment.captured event
   ‚Üí Verifies signature
   ‚Üí Updates order to PROCESSING/SUCCESS
   ‚Üí Deducts stock
   ‚Üí Updates coupon usage
   
3. Order is processed successfully despite frontend failure
```

### Payment Failure
```
1. Payment fails in Razorpay
   ‚Üí Razorpay modal shows error
   
2. Frontend confirmation (if reached)
   ‚Üí Updates order to FAILED
   
3. Webhook receives payment.failed event
   ‚Üí Confirms order status as FAILED
   ‚Üí No stock deduction
```

## üé® Admin Dashboard Updates

### New Columns
| Order Status | Payment Status | Meaning |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| PENDING | PENDING | Order created, awaiting payment |
| PROCESSING | SUCCESS | Payment received, order being fulfilled |
| SHIPPED | SUCCESS | Order shipped, payment complete |
| DELIVERED | SUCCESS | Order delivered successfully |
| FAILED | FAILED | Payment or order processing failed |
| CANCELLED | SUCCESS/REFUNDED | Order cancelled (may need refund) |

### Visual Indicators
- üü° PENDING (Yellow) - Awaiting action
- üü¢ SUCCESS (Green) - Completed successfully
- üî¥ FAILED (Red) - Failed/Cancelled
- ‚ö™ REFUNDED (Gray) - Money returned

## üîí Security Improvements

1. **Signature Verification**: All payments verified with Razorpay signatures
2. **Webhook Authentication**: Webhooks require valid signature
3. **Server-side Price Validation**: Prices fetched from DB, not trusted from frontend
4. **Idempotency**: Duplicate webhook events handled gracefully
5. **Stock Validation**: Stock checked before order creation
6. **Data Sanitization**: All inputs validated with Zod schemas
